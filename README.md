#Retail Sales Data Analysis using SQL & Python
 
#Project Overview:----
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.  
I first cleaned the data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and then uploaded it to PostgreSQL for structured storage and analysis.

#Workflow:-----
1️:- - Data Cleaning (Python)
    - Handled missing values & corrected data types.
    - Standardized date/time formats.
    - Removed duplicate records and outliers.

2️:- Data Upload (PostgreSQL)
   - Created database and table schema.
   - Inserted cleaned data for efficient querying.

3:- Data Analysis (SQL)**
   - Identified peak sales hours and customer buying patterns.
   - Analyzed top-performing product categories.
   - Segmented customers based on purchase frequency and age group.
   - Calculated total revenue, profit margins, and cost of goods sold (COGS).

# Key Insights from the Analysis
🔹 Evening hours (5 PM onwards) had the highest sales.
🔹 Clothing & Electronics were the most frequently purchased items.
🔹 Customers aged 25-40 generated the highest revenue.
🔹 Bulk purchases had lower margins due to discount strategies.
